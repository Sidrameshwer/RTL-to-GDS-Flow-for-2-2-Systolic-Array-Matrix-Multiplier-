- The tool used for synthesis (converting RTL to a gate-level netlist) is Synopsys DC.
- TCL script is run, that generates the netlist file(.dc.v) and a SDC file(Synopsys Design Constraint).
- The generated netlist is simulated using Symopsys VCS.


__Below is the simulation result of the generated netlist__
